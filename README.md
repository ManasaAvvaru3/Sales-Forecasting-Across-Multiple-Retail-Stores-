Sales Forecasting Across Multiple Retail Stores 

Introduction
Our goal is to investigate how customers behave in the different establishments. Our objective is to determine how certain actions, including promotions and the opening of new locations, impact consumer behavior and to create and provide an final product that provides the finance team's analysts with this forecast.

Learning Outcomes 
Technical Skills: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, HTML and CSS ,Flask. Interns  will also improve their code modularization skills. 
Creation of new features 
Predictive pipeline: Exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, building and f ine-tuning models Building model using MLOps Techniques 
Deployment: Interns will know how to serve predictions in a web app.  

Task 1 - Exploration of customer purchasing behaviour 
Exploratory data analysis is the lifeblood of every meaningful machine-learning project. It helps us unravel the nature of the data and sometimes informs how you go about modelling. A careful exploration of the data encapsulates checking all available features, checking their interactions and correlation as well as their variability with respect to the target.  

Task 2 - Prediction of store sales 
Prediction of sales is the central task in this challenge. you want to predict daily sales in various stores up to 6 weeks ahead of time. This will help the company plan ahead of time.  

Task 3 - Serving predictions on a web interface 
show a plot that shows the predicted sales amount and number of customers. It should also allow the user to download the prediction in the form of a csv table. 

Focus areas
We should bear in mind that this is a simplistic demonstration, using only a single store's data and making relatively basic assumptions (e.g., no promotional or holiday effects other than weekly and yearly seasonality). It would be wise to combine data from several stores and possibly take into account extra aspects like deals, holidays, and other outside variables that could affect sales in order to create a more accurate and reliable forecast.

In brief
A portion of the data's seasonality has been effectively captured by the model. It forecasts an increase in sales around the end of the year, which corresponds with the spike in holiday shopping. This is encouraging since it shows that the model has taken into account both the timing and the raw sales data.
